# Estimation of flow trajectories in a multiple lines network
## Case studies with *transports publics de la région lausannoise* (tl) data

## Guillaume Guex, Romain Loup, François Bavaud

This project is aimed at reconstructing the probable passenger trajectories in a multimodal network, by only using the number of passengers entering and leaving at each stops. Case studies are shown on the *transports publics de la région lausannoise* (tl) data
